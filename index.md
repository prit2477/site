  content: | 
    You want to work on making your app awesome, not messing with infrastructure… but every time someone joins your team, you need to spend 2 days installing stuff, no one has the same versions, and you get a call at 10pm and have to spend the next 17 hours debugging your server because someone ‘upgraded’ a dependency.

    Docker can make that go away.

    Add to that easy deploys, easy scaling, load balancing, app inter-op, and all the little features you'll need for your growing company, and you have a winner.

    But here's the thing: to get rid of all that pain you're feeling, you have to go actually learn Docker. Which can be intimidating.

    That's why we made LearnDocker.online. It's the easiest way to go from zero to docker master, all in four simple courses.
